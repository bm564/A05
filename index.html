            <h1> Our Mission</h1>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
                Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
                and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
                <blockquote>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless."
                </blockquote>
